# Challenges of Modules-Monolith
- Defining Modules & Bounded Contexts
- Communication between modules
- Module **data independence** and **isolation**

# Defining Modules
- Modules represent cohesive sets of functionalities
- Bounded Context
    - The boundary within a domain where a particular domain model applies
- Each Module can be treated like a separate "application"

# Modules Architecture
- Layered architecture
- Clean architecture
- Vertical slice architecture

# Module Communication
## Method Calls
- Fast, in-memory calls
- Only allowed to call the public API of other Modules
#### Trade-offs
- Introduces runtime coupling
- Requires new implementation when extracting Module into separate service

Orders Module -- API Method Call --> Catalog Module

## Messaging
- Asynchronous
- Possible to implement RPC-Like Calls
   - Modules send request/response messages
- Define interfaces for message contracts
   - Shared library
- Completely decoupled
- Easy to extract Modules into separate services
#### Trade-offs
- Downside performance because all communication is done through messages

# Module Data Independence
- Every Module is responsible for its own data
- Querying data directly from other Modules is not allowed
- There are different levels of data isolation between Modules


# Module Data Isolation
- Same database (no isolation)
- Same database, different schema
- Different databases
- Different databases type (DBMS)
