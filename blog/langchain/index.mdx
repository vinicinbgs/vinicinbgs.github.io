Router x Fully Autonomous

In the router the agent has less control of the flow, it can only choose the next step to take.

In the fully autonomous agent, the agent can choose the next step and also decide to stop the flow. This is a more powerful agent, but it is also more dangerous. The agent can choose to do anything, including stopping the flow and not returning any results. This is a more advanced use case and should be used with caution.

Router has more application reliability
Fully autonomous has less application reliability


**Nodes: are the building blocks of the flow.**  
They are the individual steps that the agent can take. Each node has a specific function and can be used to perform a specific task. Nodes can be combined to create more complex flows.

**Edges: are the connections between the nodes.**  
They define the flow of the agent and determine which node will be executed
