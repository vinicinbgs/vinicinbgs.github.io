### Label
```sh
# Count pods with a specific label
kubectl get pods -l env=dev -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}' | xargs -n 1 | wc -l

# Count all resources with a specific label
kubectl get all -A -l env=prod -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}' | xargs -n 1 | wc -l

# Get all pods with a group of specific label
kubectl get pods -l env=prod,bu=finance,tier=frontend -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}'
```

```sh
kubectl label node/node01 color=blue
kubectl create deployment blue --image nginx --replicas 3
```

### Kubernetes Taints
In Kubernetes, taints and tolerations work together to control on which nodes Pods are allowed 
(or forced) to schedule. They're the inverse of labels/selectors: instead of saying “only put pods with this label on those nodes,” you taint a node to say “no pods may land here unless they explicitly tolerate the taint.”

```sh
kubectl taint nodes <node-name> key=value:Effect # add taint
kubectl describe node <node-name> | grep Taints # check taints
kubectl taint nodes <node-name> key=value:NoSchedule- # remove taint
```

##### Effects
- **NoSchedule: ** Pods that do not tolerate this taint will never be scheduled onto the node.
- **PreferNoSchedule: ** Kubernetes will try not to schedule non-tolerating Pods there, but won’t guarantee it.
- **NoExecute: ** Existing Pods that don’t tolerate the taint will be evicted, and new non-tolerating Pods will never be scheduled.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  tolerations:
    - key: "key"
      operator: "Equal"      # or "Exists"
      value: "value"         # only for Equal
      effect: "NoSchedule"
      # optional: how long to tolerate (seconds)
      tolerationSeconds: 3600
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx

```

### Kubernetes Debugging
```sh
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n <namespace>
```

- OOMKilled: Out of Memory Killed, the container was killed because the memory necessary to run the container was not available.
- CrashLoopBackOff: The container is crashing and restarting repeatedly.
- ImagePullBackOff: The image cannot be pulled from the registry.
- ErrImagePull: The image cannot be pulled from the registry.

#### Resource Limits
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: my-container
      image: nginx
      resources:
        requests:
          memory: "64Mi"
          cpu: "250m"
        limits:
          memory: "128Mi"
          cpu: "500m"
```


### DaemonSet
```sh
kubectl create deployment example --image=nginx -n example --dry-run=client -o yaml > example.yaml
```

Change the kind from Deployment to DaemonSet and remove the replicas field. 
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment # change it to > DaemonSet
```
